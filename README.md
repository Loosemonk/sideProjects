An interval is the relational difference between two musical notes.
Understanding intervals can be a powerful instrument (pun intended) in building melodic compositions.

Interval Finder will do exactly that, find your musical interval. 
This application will take two notes (a lower note and a higher note), supplied by the user,
and then deliver the interval.
