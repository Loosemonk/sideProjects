# Benford Calculator
This program is designed to take a dataset of numbers, delivered in the form of a text file and deduce how closely the dataset follows Benford's Law. 

Benford's Law or the first-digit law, observes the frequency of the leading digits in datasets of real life numerical collections.
A phenomena not entirely understood, Benford's law is revealed in a wide range of datasets. From populations to the distance of stars in the observable universe, Benford's Law inconceivably connects the most obscure and random number sets and packages them into a neat,consistent order.
